# binks-assignment-frontend

This project is a small social media app that includes the following features:

* Authentication: Users can register and log in to the app securely using features such as password hashing and JSON web tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization.
* User Management: Users can create and update their profiles, including features such as editing their profile information.
* Post Management: Users can create, edit, and delete posts, as well as like and comment on posts made by other users.
* Security Measures: The app uses libraries such as bcrypt for password hashing and validation for protecting user data and preventing security vulnerabilities.
* Database Integration: The app utilizes the Mongoose library to interact with a MongoDB database for efficient storage and retrieval of user profiles, posts, likes, and comments.

These features are designed to provide a basic yet functional social media experience for users, while also ensuring security and data integrity.
